            <p>Exipure is an incredible weight loss formula that emplys eight different plant and herb extracts that together work towards increasing brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the body. BAT is actually a fat burning furnace and plays a key role in weight loss. In fact, BAT is capable of burning calories 300 times faster than regular fat cells. By burning calories round the clock, it assists you in maintaining a caloric deficit diet.</p>

It is the only supplement out there with a proprietary combination of 8 exotic nutrients and plants that focus on low brown adipose tissue (BAT) levels that may otherwise lead to unexplained weight gain. Increasing those BAT levels even in tiny amounts makes Exipure increase the fat burning power of the body to great extents. Plus, higher levels of BAT also increase the energy levels of the body and jumpstart your metabolism.</p>
